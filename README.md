Taskcluster Service Skeleton
============================

This is a skeleton detailing best-pratices for writing taskcluster services, and
serves to illustrate by example how our libraries should be used. This is meant
for taskcluster developers and aims to help us get started quickly, as well as
reaching consensus on the right way to do things.


## Post-Deployment Verification

This service has no deployment, so there is no post-deployment verification.
But if this was a real service, this is place we would write how the verify
correct deployment.
